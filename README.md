# Simply Love Vertical (StepMania 5)

![Arrow Logo](https://i.imgur.com/oZmxyGo.png)
======================

Simply Love Vertical is designed for single-player setups with monitors in portrait mode. Turning the monitor sideways increases the arrow scrolling space by 1.7x, meaning that a 23" monitor gains as much vertical play area as a 39" monitor.

## Setup

This theme is based on [quietly-turning's Simply-Love-SM5](https://github.com/quietly-turning/Simply-Love-SM5) and the readme assumes you are familiar with it. If not, check out the original repo.

The theme is currently in alpha, and does not have released versions. To install, download/clone the repository, add the contents to your Themes/ folder, then switch to the theme in Stepmania options.

## Limitations compared to Simply Love
